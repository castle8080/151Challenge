151Challenge
============

The 151 Challenge Website

This will eventually have the code for a 151 Challenge tracker website.
Our shoulders will be strong and our livers prepared.


For developers:
This is built in the Scala Play framework. I've found Intellij 14 to have great support for it with the Scala plugin.

Simple development cycle is to use "activator run" to run a test webserver at http://localhost:9000. Once this is running,
you can simply edit any of the scala.html or scala files and changes will be reflected in your browser on refresh.
